            <h2>About Hatake TCG</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Hatake TCG, a Swedish startup founded by passionate trading card game enthusiasts. We're launching in 2025 with a mission to provide premium, sustainable accessories for TCG players and collectors across Europe.</p>
            <p>Our journey began with a simple idea: to create products that not only protect your cards but also enhance your gaming experience. From matte sleeves to duffel bags, every item is designed with the player in mind.</p>
            <p>Join us as we redefine TCG accessories with quality, innovation, and community at the core. Follow us on <a href="https://discord.gg/Puq5ncSbjt" target="_blank">Discord</a> to stay updated!</p>
        </section>
       <h3>Our Story</h3>
             <p>Thank you for visiting our website. Hatake TCG is a project founded by Ernst-William Hertz, a Swedish entrepreneur based in FalkÃ¶ping, Sweden. The journey began in February 2025, with countless hours dedicated to crafting the vision and business documents alongside Mark Jensen from Esbjerg, Denmark.</p>
             <p>Ernst-William and Mark share a unique bond, having once lived together and overcome personal challenges, including substance use. Now, both have been sober for yearsâ€”Mark for four years and Ernst-William for threeâ€”and are committed to building a successful company together. This venture is a family-driven project, with support from our loved ones and a valued partner, Virre, based in MalmÃ¶. Virre brings extraordinary experience and will represent Hatake TCG at various conventions, where his warm and engaging personality will shine.</p>
             <p>While many individuals have contributed to this project behind the scenes, some are still deciding whether to go public with their involvement as we prepare to register the stock company by the end of June. The Hatake TCG logo was thoughtfully designed by Richard Moreau, whose creativity has helped shape our brand identity.</

            <h2>Behind the Scenes at Hatake TCG</h2>
            <p>Weâ€™re committed to transparency. Hereâ€™s how we create our premium TCG accessories, ensuring they meet the highest standards for players and collectors.</p>
            
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>Our products are designed in Sweden, with direct input from the TCG community via our Discord server (<a href="https://discord.gg/Puq5ncSbjt" target="_blank">join us here</a>). We prioritize functionality, sustainability, and style, creating accessories like our duffel bags with padded compartments tailored for tournaments.</p>
            
            <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>We partner with a trusted supplier in China, recommended by a Magic: The Gathering acquaintance, ensuring ethical practices and high-quality production. We oversee the process closely to maintain consistency and quality, focusing on eco-friendly materials like recyclable plastics.</p>
            
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>Every product undergoes rigorous testing to exceed industry standards. For example, our matte sleeves are tested for shuffle durability, lasting 20% longer than leading competitors, and our deckboxes are tested for magnetic closure strength to prevent accidental openings.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Journey So Far</h3>
            <p>On April 8, 2025, we placed an order for samples to ensure our products meet your expectations: 3x PU Deck Boxes, 3x 35pt Top-Loaders, 3x 130pt Top-Loaders, and 3x 480-slot Top-Loader Binders (12 slots per page) with zippers. These samples are being tested by our community to refine our designs before the full launch.</p>
